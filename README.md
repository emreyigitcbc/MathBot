# MathBOT

MathBOT is a calculator bot for discord. It reads messages and tries to evaluate it. If it can evaluate, then it sends the result.

This bot doesn't need any prefix.

Examples:
- If you write "5+5", bot will reply with "5+5 = 10"
- *I imported math lib so you can calculate everything in discord!*
- If you use something from math module like "math.cos(90)" you will get "math.cos(90) = 0"
- I don't know why but "..." means "Ellipsis" for some reason, nevermind it.
- If you add any chracter to your message (except math module), it won't reply you.


## Usage

It needs `discord.py` module to run. You can install it via:

```bash
pip install discord.py
```

When you download bot, do not forget to change `token` variable in `main.py`
